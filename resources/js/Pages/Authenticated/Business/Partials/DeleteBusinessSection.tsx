            When you delete your business, you will lose access to all the
            resources associated with it, such as accounts, products, bills, and
            business data. They will be permanently erased from our system and
            cannot be recovered.
          </p>
          <p className="text-normal mt-3 text-gray-600">
            To prevent accidental deletion of large businesses, you must first
            delete all other accounts under your business. This
            is a safety measure to ensure that you are fully aware of the
            consequences of deleting your business.
